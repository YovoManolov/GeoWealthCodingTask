Nine-letter words in english that stay words after removing one letter at a time.

Condition: 
Find all nine-letter words in this file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikiiv/JavaCodingTestOne/master/scrabble-words.txt

That satisfy the requirement : 
	When we remove one letter at a time from any nine-letter word, no matter from where in the word, the new word 
	is a valid word (exists in the list of words). When we reach single letter words, the only valid ones are: 
	"I" and "A" 

Solution approach utilizes:
 Recursion,
 HashMap,
 TreeSet
